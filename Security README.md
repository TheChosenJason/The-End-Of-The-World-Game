This application is completely safe to use. It is a simple program developed using Python and packaged into an executable file using PyInstaller.
Some antivirus software may flag the file as a potential virus because PyInstaller bundles the script and its dependencies into a single executable file.
This packaging method is sometimes mistaken for malicious behavior due to its similarity to how certain viruses operate. However, this is a false positive and
does not indicate any actual threat. Rest assured, the application contains no harmful code and is designed solely for its intended functionality.

If you have concerns, you can verify the application's safety by running it through trusted tools like VirusTotal or reviewing the source code directly.
